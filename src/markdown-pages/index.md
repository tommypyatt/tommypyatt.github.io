I'm a front-end web developer, based in Manchester. Here's a little about me.

I have worked in the e-commerce space, mostly with Magento, for a little over 10 years. I've worked extensively with plenty of front-end frameworks: Backbone, Knockout, React, Redux, SASS, Handlebars, Gulp, Webpack, if you're a keywords kind of person. I'm not overly attached to any particular tool or framework, and I love learning new stuff, but I have had the most fun working with and learning React. This site is built with Gatsby.

I care about code. That is, I take care to write code that is maintainable, understandable by others, doesn't create more new problems than it solves, and does more than just work or fix the bug. I like to inspire others to do the same.

I consider myself a simple person. Partly because I'm aware of my own limitations as a human being, but also partly by choice. I've written software for long enough to know that complexity should be added as and when necessary, and not for the sake of it.

There are some things that I consider essential though, such as version control (I love Git), a good issue tracking tool like Jira, and regular communication with my team.

Occasionally I make mistakes, and I learn from them.

I believe there's great, and often underappreciated, value in modularity and separation of concerns.
