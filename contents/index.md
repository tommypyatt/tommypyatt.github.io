I'm a front-end web developer. I live in Manchester, England, which is the greatest city in the world.

I work with Magento and use various front-end technologies to solve problems and make beautiful, maintainable and responsive interfaces.

I love technology and the open web, because it is amazing. I am a big fan of open-source software and an advocate of using GNU/Linux-based systems for everything.

Confucious said learning without thought is labour lost; thought without learning is perilous. It is important to me that I am always learning something. Open source software is excellent for this as, by definition, all information about an open source system is made freely available to anyone who wants to learn from it.

Some of my personal interests are drawing/painting, psychology, photography, chess, humanism and space pirates.
